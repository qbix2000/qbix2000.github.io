I have written this site to experiment using AI to help me code and to see if my theory of using a purely client side javascript and html website could be written to allow me to create an interval timer.

Virtually all the CSS was generated using Gemini, whereas the html and viritually all the javascript were written by me.

The site uses local storage to store your routines in a JSON format which are loaded on the fly when the site loads.

If you have no routines it will put 3 standard ones in (purtely for my benefit, no one elses), but they can be deleted if you wish.

You can also export your routines as a json file so that you can load them in somewhere else.

I may allow users to store them in google drive or somewhere like that some day, but I am in no hurry to do so yet.
